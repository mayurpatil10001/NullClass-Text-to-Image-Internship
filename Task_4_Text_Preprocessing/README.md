# Task 4: Text Preprocessing

## Objective
This task demonstrates text cleaning and preprocessing techniques essential for text-to-image generation. It covers removing special characters, converting to lowercase, and tokenization.

## Dataset Used
- Text samples with various formats (provided in the notebook)

## Libraries Used
- `re` - For regular expressions (text cleaning)
- `matplotlib` - For visualization
- `collections.Counter` - For word frequency analysis

## Implementation
The notebook `text_cleaning.ipynb` includes:
- Text cleaning function (lowercase conversion, special character removal)
- Word tokenization
- Word frequency analysis
- Visualization of word frequencies

## Results & Metrics
- Successfully cleans text by removing special characters
- Converts text to lowercase
- Splits text into tokens
- Analyzes and visualizes word frequencies

## Sample Outputs
- Original vs cleaned text comparison
- Word frequency bar charts
- Multiple text preprocessing examples

## How to Run
1. Install required packages: `pip install matplotlib`
2. Open `text_cleaning.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells to see text preprocessing examples
