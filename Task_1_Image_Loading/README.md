# Task 1: Image Loading and Display

## Objective
This task demonstrates how to load and display images using Python libraries like matplotlib. It serves as a foundation for working with image data in text-to-image generation tasks.

## Dataset Used
- Sample image: `sample_image.jpg` (or any image file in supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .bmp)

## Libraries Used
- `matplotlib` - For image display and visualization
- `os` - For file path operations

## Implementation
The notebook `image_display.ipynb` contains:
- Image loading functionality with error handling
- Image display with custom styling
- Support for multiple image formats

## Results
- Successfully loads and displays images
- Validates file paths and formats
- Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs

## Sample Output
The notebook displays the loaded image with a blue border and title showing the filename.

## How to Run
1. Place an image file (e.g., `sample_image.jpg`) in this directory
2. Open `image_display.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Update the image path in the notebook if needed
4. Run all cells
